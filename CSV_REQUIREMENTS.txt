  • AT LEAST 8-10 players needed

================================================================================

HOW TO SAVE FROM EXCEL CORRECTLY:

1. File → Save As
2. Format: "CSV UTF-8 (.csv)" ← IMPORTANT
   (NOT "CSV (Comma delimited)" which adds extra quotes)
3. Click Save
4. If asked about losing formatting, click "Continue"

================================================================================

HOW TO SAVE FROM GOOGLE SHEETS:

1. File → Download
2. Select "Comma Separated Values (.csv)"
3. Opens CSV file
4. This format is correct by default

================================================================================

VERIFY YOUR CSV:

Open in text editor (NOT Excel) and check:

Line 1:
  Should start exactly: Name,Position,Team,Salary,Predicted_DK_Points
  No spaces after commas
  No quote characters

Other lines:
  Should have same number of commas as header
  No quotes around values
  No special characters

Example when opened in text editor:
  Name,Position,Team,Salary,Predicted_DK_Points
  Aaron Judge,OF,NYY,12000,55.2
  Juan Soto,OF,NYM,11500,52.1
  Mike Trout,OF,LAA,10500,50.5

================================================================================

MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS:

✓ Exactly 4 required columns
✓ At least 8 rows of data (8+ players)
✓ All numeric columns actually numeric
✓ All position codes valid for sport
✓ No special formatting or quotes
✓ UTF-8 encoding
✓ .csv file extension

================================================================================

TESTING YOUR CSV:

1. Use provided sample_players.csv as reference
2. Compare your CSV to sample exactly
3. Open both in text editor side-by-side
4. Look for differences in:
   - Column names
   - Spacing
   - Data format
   - Quote marks

If sample works but yours doesn't:
  • Your CSV format is wrong
  • Follow sample format exactly

If sample also fails:
  • Backend issue
  • Check: curl http://localhost:8000/health

================================================================================

POSITION CODE VALIDATION:

Your CSV positions MUST match sport you selected:

MLB (Baseball):
  ✅ C, 1B, 2B, 3B, SS, OF, P, DH, UTIL
  ❌ PG, SG, SF (those are NBA)
  ❌ QB, RB, WR (those are NFL)

NBA (Basketball):
  ✅ PG, SG, SF, PF, C, UTIL
  ❌ C, 1B, 2B (those are MLB)

NFL (Football):
  ✅ QB, RB, WR, TE, K, DEF, UTIL
  ❌ C, OF, P (those are MLB)

================================================================================

COMMON MISTAKES:

❌ Column name different:
   Using: Player (should be: Name)
   Using: Proj (should be: Predicted_DK_Points)
   Using: Pos (should be: Position)

❌ Salary formatting:
   Using: $12000 (should be: 12000)
   Using: 12,000 (should be: 12000)
   Using: 12K (should be: 12000)

❌ Points formatting:
   Using: 55.2% (should be: 55.2)
   Using: 55pts (should be: 55)

❌ Position codes:
   Using: Outfield (should be: OF)
   Using: Pitcher (should be: P)
   Using: catcher (should be: C)

❌ File format:
   Saving as: .xlsx (should be: .csv)
   Saving as: CSV (Comma delimited) (should be: CSV UTF-8)

================================================================================
