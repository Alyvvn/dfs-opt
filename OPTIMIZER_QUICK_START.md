# Optimizer Quick Start Guide

## Step-by-Step: Getting Your First Lineup

### Step 1: Prepare Your CSV File

Your CSV must have these exact columns:
```
Name,Position,Team,Salary,Predicted_DK_Points
```

Example:
```csv
Name,Position,Team,Salary,Predicted_DK_Points
Aaron Judge,OF,NYY,12000,55.2
Juan Soto,OF,NYM,11500,52.1
Mike Trout,OF,LAA,10500,50.5
Kyle Schwarber,OF,PHI,10000,48.2
Corey Seager,SS,TEX,9500,47.1
Bryce Harper,OF,PHI,9000,46.0
Jose Altuve,2B,HOU,8500,45.3
Salvador Perez,C,KC,5500,39.1
Gerrit Cole,P,NYY,9500,45.1
```

**Requirements:**
- At least 8-10 players
- Salary must be numeric (no $ or commas)
- Points must be numeric (no % symbols)
- Position codes must be valid (see below)

### Step 2: Start Python Backend

```bash
cd draftkings_startup
python -m uvicorn api:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

You should see:
```
INFO:     Application startup complete
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000
```

### Step 3: Open Optimizer Page

Go to: http://localhost:3000/optimizer

### Step 4: Load CSV

1. Click **"Load CSV"** button in Settings panel
2. Select your CSV file
3. You should see: "Loaded X players"

### Step 5: Adjust Settings (Optional)

**Quick Settings:**
- **Min Unique**: How many unique players between lineups (default: 3)
- **Number of Lineups**: How many to generate (default: 100)
- **Min/Max Salary**: Total lineup salary range

**For MLB 9-man lineups:**
- Min Salary: $40,000 - $45,000
- Max Salary: $50,000 - $52,000

### Step 6: Run Optimization

Click **"Run Contest Sim"** button

Wait for generation... (usually 5-30 seconds)

### Step 7: View Results

Your generated lineups appear below with:
- Player names
- Positions
- Salaries

## Exposure Settings

(In Exposure tab)

- **Team Exposure**: % of lineups a team can appear in
- **Player Exposure**: % of lineups a player can appear in

Example: 50% player exposure = player in 50 of 100 lineups

## Troubleshooting

### ‚ùå "API Error 500"
- Check if Python backend is running
- Try: `curl http://localhost:8000/health`
- Should return: `{"status":"ok"}`

### ‚ùå "Only names show, no other data"
- CSV columns wrong
- Make sure exactly: `Name,Position,Team,Salary,Predicted_DK_Points`
- No extra spaces!

### ‚ùå "Infeasible problem"
- Salary constraints too tight
- Lower Min Salary to $40,000
- Raise Max Salary to $52,000
- Or reduce Min Unique to 1

### ‚ùå No lineups generated
- Check player pool (need 8+)
- Verify position coverage (P, C, SS, etc.)
- Check constraint settings
- Try sample CSV first

See **TROUBLESHOOTING.md** for more details

## Advanced Tips

### Better Projections
- Use DraftKings' own projections if available
- Blend multiple projection models
- Adjust for weather, injuries

### Stack Optimization
- Stack QB with receivers/RB
- Stack pitcher with hitters when favorable
- Avoid stacking pitchers with opposite team batters

### Exposure Management
- Reduce exposure on high-correlation stacks
- Increase exposure on high-EV plays
- Randomize to reduce predictability

### Bankroll Management
- Never play more than 5% of bankroll per contest
- Use conservative projections
- Track results to calibrate edge
